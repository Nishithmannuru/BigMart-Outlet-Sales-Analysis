# BigMart-Outlet-Sales-Analysis
Built an predictive model which can predict the item outlet sales at a particular outlet. The main use of this model is to make sure how the business is being affected in terms of sales. The dataset consists of 8523 records under 12 attributes. I have used SAS Programming to make this analysis.
